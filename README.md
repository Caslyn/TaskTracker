# Welcome to Task Tracker! 

Task Tracker is a working clone of Pivotal Tracker, an agile project management tool for software development.  

## How Does It Work? 

Each **project** contains four **trackers** - Icebox, Backlog, Current, Done - to manage your tasks, known as 'stories'. 

+ Icebox: holds stories that have yet to be prioritized. Stories can stay on 'ice' indefinitely or until ready to be prioritized into the backlog or current boxes.

+ Backlog: holds stories that are scheduled to be performed in the future.

+ Current: holds stories that are currently in progress.

+ Done: holds stories that have been completed, delivered, and accepted.


**Stories** represent a concrete deliverable project task. 

##### Point Estimation

Each story has a point estimate: a relative measure of complexity and risk inherent in the task. Task Tracker's default point scale ranges from 0 (little ecomplexity) to 4 (much complexity). Iterations are determined by the point totals of the stories within a tracker; likewise the user may better prioritize and schedule stories based on their point value. 

##### Story Types

A story may be categorized as one of four types: Feature, Chore, Bug, Release.
